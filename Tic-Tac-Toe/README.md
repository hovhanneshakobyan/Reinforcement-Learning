Features

Reinforcement Learning: Agents learn optimal Tic-Tac-Toe strategies.

Training Mode: Train two RL agents over multiple epochs.

Competing Mode: Trained RL agents play against each other.

Human vs. RL: Play against a trained RL agent in both console and GUI modes.

GUI: Interactive game board to play with the RL agent visually.(Coming soon.)

Requirements
